        "Linear regression is a statistical method used to describe and quantify the relationship between one or more predictor variables and a response variable. It works by fitting a straight line that best represents how the response changes as the predictors change. The slope of the line indicates the direction and strength of the relationship, while model metrics such as R² describe how well the model explains the observed data. Linear regression is widely used in agriculture, economics, and the natural sciences to identify patterns and support data-informed decision making.\n",

Through this workflow, you will learn how to build, visualize, and interpret regression models, and how to think critically about what these models can — and cannot — tell us about agricultural systems.\n"
